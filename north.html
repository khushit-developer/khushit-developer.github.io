        <h3>1.KUMBH MELA</h3>
        <p>Kumbh Mela is the biggest fair in India. It takes place every 12 years in four cities - Prayagraj (Allahabad), Haridwar, Ujjain and Nashik. The Kumbh Mela in Prayag being the major one is celebrated on a vast scale. Pilgrims from all over the
            country gather and pay homage to river Ganga. They take dips in the holy water to wash away their sins. Since this festival is celebrated only in 12 years, the government spends generously on the stalls, poojas, kirtans and pilgrimage facilities.
